## [Unreleased]

### changed
- Added message `set_awg`, which allows clients to turn on square wave pulse generator at custom rep rates. Available only if `trigger_self=False`.


## [2022.4.0]

### changed
- channel configuration no longer specifies sample/baseline baseline start/stop, or processing method.  Arbitrary processing to be done in processing scripts.
- daemon distinguishes between raw_channels, which are the native inputs of the device (e.g. A, B, C, D), and channels, which are the arbitrary outputs of the processing script.  Consequently, measure must be run once to establish stable/accurate channel parameters.
- removed `get_sample time` client message.  Use `get_mappings()["time"]` instead
- removed `get_measured_shots` client message.  `get_measured_samples` returns shots and samples data, so you can bin this array instead.

### fixed
- Shutdowns handle failed device close requests, which make client restarts more dependable.
- gui has responsive channel form for all channels.
- channel config `invert` now works

### Added
- initial release
